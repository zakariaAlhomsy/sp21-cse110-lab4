2. 20

4. error, because declaring with let doesn't allow the variable "return" to be accessed outside of the block
5. error, cannot assign a value to a constant variable
6. error, cannot assign a value to a constant variable

Part 1B
1. it will output "3" because the array "prices" has a length of 3 and "i" will increment until it gets to 3.
2. it will output "150" because on the final iteration of the for loop prices[i] will be 300 and 1-discount will be .5, so 300 * .5 = 150
3. it will output "150" because it will have the same value as the "discountedPrice" variable.
4. The functions returns an array with values: 50,100,150. because it essentially just halves the values of the array that was used as an argument to call the function.
5. error, it cannot access the variable "i" because the console.log is not in the same block
6. error, it cannot access the variable "discountedPrice" because the console.log is not in the same block
7. it will output "150" because it will have the same value as the "discountedPrice" variable. (the let declaration doesn't affect anything here because the console.log is within the same block)
8. The functions returns an array with values: 50,100,150.(the let declaration doesn't affect anything here because the console.log is within the same block)
9. error, it cannot access the variable "i" because the console.log is not in the same block
10. the output will be "3" because that is the length of the array "prices"
11. The function returns an array with values: 50,100,150. (the const declaration doesn't affect anything because it only doesn't allow the variable to be reassigned, in this case we are not reassigning the "discounted" variable)
12. 
A. student.name
B. student["Grad Year"]
C. student.greeting()
D. student["Favorite Teacher"].name
E. student.courseload[0]

13. 
A. '32' the string turns the int 2 into a string and concatenates
B. 1    turns 3 into an int 
C. 3    turns into an arithmetic process
D. 3null   turns null into a string
E. 4        turns into an arithmetic process where the value of true is 1
F. 0        turns into an arithmetic process where the value of false is 0
G. '3undefined'   undefined becomes a strings and concatenates
H. NaN      turns into an arithmetic process

14.     
A. true             arithmetic process where 2 is bigger then 1
B. false        arithmetic process
C. true     compares 2 variables without taking datatype into account
D. false    compares datatype
E. false    since true has value 1 it doesn't equal 2
F. true     boolean(2) has value true

15. == compares 2 variables but ignores the datatypes
=== compares 2 variables but takes the datatypes into account

17.  2,4,6
before it pushed the value into newArr it doubles the value of the variable so it would put 2,4,6 into the array
